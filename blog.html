<p> Hi, I am RÃ©my, a research fellow and junior group leader at the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (a research unit of INSERM and University of Paris) in Paris. I am currently working on the interface of machine learning and physcs. Using insights from phyiscs, our group aims to devellop physics inspired neural networks to perform automated model discovery on spatio-temporal data. The tool we develloped for this is called DeepMoD (Deep learning driven Model Discovery) and it is described in more detail in the projects page.  


	Besides the physics inspired neural networks, I have a background in theoretical biophysics and soft matter physics. In the past, I modeled the growth and physical regulation of dendritic spines and the mechanics of the cytoskeleton. Alongside I picked up some more generic soft matter projects, examples of which are the crowding induced clustering of active particles under confinement and the role of crowding in diffusion curved environments. </p>
