## Summary:

DeepMoD is a Deep learning based Model Discovery algorithm. DeepMoD discovers the partial differential equation underlying a spatio-temporal data set using sparse regression on a library of possible functions and their derivatives. A neural network approximates the data and constructs the function library, but it also performs the sparse regression.

This tool has been released as package in both Tensorflow and Pytorch. Note that all the further developmement happens on the  <a href="https://github.com/PhIMaL/DeePyMoD_torch">Pytorch version</a> and that the  <a href="https://github.com/PhIMaL/DeePyMoD">Tensorflow version</a>  is not further maintained. 

The paper is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09406">arXiv</a>
