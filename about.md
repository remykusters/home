<p> Hi, I am RÃ©my, a research fellow and junior group leader at the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (a research unit of INSERM and University of Paris) in Paris. I am currently working on the interface between machine learning and physcs. Using insights from phyiscs the aim of our group is to use physics inspired neural networks to perform automated model discovery from spatio-temporal data. In short, we try to discover the differential equation that underlies complex data-sets. The tool we develloped for this is called DeepMoD (Deep learning driven Model Discovery) and we will describe this in more detail in the projects page.  

Besides the physics inspired neural networks, I have a cbackground in theoretical biophysics and soft matter physics. In the past, I modeled the growth and physical regulation of dendritic spines and the mechanics of the cytoskeleton. Alongside I picked up some more generic soft matter projects, examples of which are the crowding induced clustering of active particles under confinement and the role of crowding in diffusion curved environments. </p>
